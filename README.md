# Portfolio
There are 4 projects in this repository that I have done to improve my analytical skills and experience with the software. 

1. Broadband Price Calculator: This project I did as part of my university project and I was asked to make a dashboard that would allow a consumer to find the best broadband according to their needs. I used Pivot Chart and a Pivot Table and made different categories to choose the consumer preferences from and find the best plan for the cheapest price.

2. Top airports analysis is a project I did myself with SQL where I found a dataset that contained the top 100 airports in the world. I analysed 
them by finding meaningful information and also importing different datasets from various places to provide better information.

3. World Happiness Report is a project I did by myself with SQL where I analysed different years with the happiness scores of each country along with the factors that have contributed. I looked into how the factors were related and if one or the other had a larger effect.

4. Factbook analysis is a project I did by myself with SQL where I analysed a dataset of facts collected by the CIA and saw which countries were leading and lagging based on demographic indicators like population, mortality, and fertility.
