    ">- United States and China have the most number of airports in top 100. <br>\n",
    ">- Mixed number of econmoies were presented in the top 100 airports and not just high income countries. <br>\n",
    ">- In terms of international travel, most high income and upper middle income economies lead the charge.  <br>\n",

    "  \n",
    "- The data is only limited to 2020 for International Arrivals which limits further analysis to see which countries recovered from COVID the best and which were affected very badly. At the current stage, only the initial affect can be measured, which is not very ideal.\n",
    "- The data on international arrivals has been updated until 2020; however, due to that we cannot compare how many international arrivals were there with the total passengers to give us a hollistic view."
